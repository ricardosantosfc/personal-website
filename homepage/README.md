This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.2.1; note that you do **NOT** need to have Angular CLI globally installed on your machine to run this project.

Node.js (and npm) are required to install dependencies and run the project; for a list of compatible versions, refer to the official [Angular documentation](https://angular.dev/reference/versions).
If this is your first time installing Node, I recommend installing it through a [version manager](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm#using-a-node-version-manager-to-install-nodejs-and-npm), as it enables switching between different Node and npm versions across different projects.


## Install dependencies

To install project dependecies, run:

```bash
npm install
```

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

Once the server is running, your default browser will be opened on `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.


## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will compile the project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes the application for performance and speed.
